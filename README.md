# Working with HTML5 Media

## Problem Statement

The internet is a highly interactive environment. You've likely seen audio and 
video elements supporting text content, such as in news sites, blogs, social media,
or other multimedia-rich websites. You've likely encountered an all-in-one line of code
with configurable properties for creating embeddable audio and video--such as with 
YouTube and Soundcloud. However, working with self-hosted audio and video is quite 
different. You will often be working with, and manipulating, media that is uploaded 
into, or generated by your app. In this case, how can this be manually embedded in 
an application you are building?

## Demonstrate How to Embed Audio Elements in HTML5
Embedding audio can add a nice touch to a website. MySpace's original layout 
made it easy for users to customize their personal profiles. However, HTML 
was very different back then. Media elements were were far less forgiving to 
install. If you wanted to embed audio, you also needed to embed an audio player, 
which might have to be Flash, Java, or JavaScript based. The W3C wanted the web 
to remain open. If one of those providers achieved market dominance, they could 
force everyone onto their platform (eg: "The Internet, powered by Adobe Flash"). 
To avoid this, HTML5 provided us our first media solutions that weren't attached 
to a company. HTML5 gives its own default media players supported in the browser.

To include audio in a website, we can do this now by including the <audio> element. 
Enclosed within the audio element are source elements that point to the location of 
various audio file formats that will be compatible for all browsers. 
  
```
<audio controls>
  <source src="purrr.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
  <source src="purrr.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <p>Sorry your browser doesn't support HTML5 Audio! Please <a href="http://browsehappy.com/?locale=en">upgrade your browser</a>.</p>
</audio>
```

On the first line we open the `<audio>` tag with the controls attribute. This is required to 
display the audio controls to start and pause playback, adjust the recording's volume, etc. 
The presence of the `controls` attribute name itself is sufficient, no other properties are 
needed. There are optional attributes you can provide such as `autoplay` and `loop`. These 
start the audio on page load and repeat the audio after it ends. For the full list of 
accepted attributes check out the 
[MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio). 

In lines 2 and 3, we provide two different source files for playback. If the browser does not 
recognize the first filetype, it will ignore it and move on to the next. If neither of 
the formats are supported it will instead display the paragraph on line 4. If the 
browser is able to play one of the source files it will ignore any other code 
below until it reaches the closing </audio> tag. For source we must set the src 
location of the file by providing the relative path to the file, and the type which 
clues the browser as to which audio codec is suitable for that particular filetype.

## Demonstrate How To Embed Video Elements in HTML5

Embedding a video is very similar to embedding audio. This can be done by including the `<video>`
tag. Inside the video tag are source tags that point to the location of various video file 
formats. The reason we provide multiple source files is that not all browsers support both 
video codecs required for playback. By providing either an MP4 (h264) and OGV, or MP4 (h264) 
and WEBM file, we ensure that all browsers will be able to play the content.

```
<video controls>
  <source src="real-estate.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="real-estate.ogv" type="video/ogg">
  <p>Sorry your browser doesn't support HTML5 Video! Please <a href="http://browsehappy.com/?locale=en">upgrade your browser</a>.</p>
</video>
```

Similarly to audio, we will open the `<video>` tag with the controls attribute. For 
the full list of accepted attributes, you can check the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) 
On lines 2 and 3 we provide two different source files for playback. If the browser 
does not recognize the first filetype it will ignore it and move on to the next 
just the same as it does for the audio element. If neither of the formats are 
supported it will display the paragraph instead on line 4. If the browser is 
able to play one of the source files it will ignore any other code below 
until it reaches the closing </video> tag. We must use src to specify a 
relative path to the location of the file and type to tell the browser 
which video codec is suitable.

## Link to Audio and Video Converters
There are a number of free tools that will convert audio files when needed. 
See the following resource links for a few recommended free audio and video 
converters you can use to change one file type to another. This is helpful 
to create both source file types needed.

## Conclusion

In the past, it may have been a little more challenging to understand how to
embed media files into websites. With the HTML5 `audio` and `video` tags, you
are empowered to have the functionality needed for display these elements and 
other fallbacks built right into the browser for your convenience with a few 
lines of code.
